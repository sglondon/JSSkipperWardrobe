# JSSkipperWardrobe
I Added the following JavaScript to the MVC database first, Wardrobe project.
Allow the user to dynamically add content to the web app on the Home index page using onload.
Dynamically remove content from the web app on the Shoe index using oncut.
Dynamically enhance size and color of text on mouseover on the Home page index when mousing over 'Meet Skipper' and returning
to default size and color when mouseover is not being performed using mouseover and mouseout.
Allow the user to navigate to another site utilizing JS, inform the user they're being directed to another site, 
allow the user to cancel the action and if affirmed, the website opens in another browser tab. This is done in the Outfits page using
onclick and redirecting to another website.
Added a copyright with date in the footer of the website, dynamically replacing the copyright and date text to 'created by Susan London 
in the Layout.cshtml page using onmouseover and onmouseout.
Implemented an array and provided the contents of the array to the user in the Bottoms view using a function called by onclick.
Implemented my homework example oncopy in the Tops index.
Included this readme.
Added a database file that include the data and schema.
I was unable to complete the task of dynamically showing all clothing items meeting a certain criteria.  I knew I needed to identy the
items via the .innertext and create an array and an if statement to select the correct items from the db but I was only able to pull 
the first instance.  When I tried to create and view the array, the other elements were undefined.
